# ## Getting Started
# 
# In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 
# 
# The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

# ----
# ## Exploring the Data
# Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.

# ### Implementation: Data Exploration
# A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following:
# - The total number of records, `'n_records'`
# - The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
# - The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
# - The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.
# 
# ** HINT: ** You may need to look at the table above to understand how the `'income'` entries are formatted. 

# In[2]:

# TODO: Total number of records
# n_records = len(data['income'])

# print (data[data['income'] > 50000]).head

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
n_at_most_50k = len(data[(data['income'] == '<=50K')])

# TODO: Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = (float(n_greater_50k)/float(n_records))*100
# greater_percent = n_greater_50k*100/n_records

# Print the results
print "Total number of records: {}".format(n_records)
print "Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k)
print "Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k)

# ----
# ## Preparing the Data
# Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured â€” this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

# ### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
# A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 
# 
# Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.

# In[3]:

# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)


# For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.
# 
# Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 

# In[4]:

# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)
features_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_log_transformed, transformed = True)


# ### Normalizing Numerical Features
# In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.
# 
# Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.

# In[5]:

# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']

features_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)
features_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(data.head(n = 5))
display(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))


# ### Implementation: Data Preprocessing
# 
# From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.
# 
# |   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
# | :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
# | 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
# | 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
# | 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
# 
# Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.
#  - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
#    - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.

# In[6]:

# TODO: One-hot encode the 'features_log_minmax_transform' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features_final = pd.get_dummies(features_log_minmax_transform)
#display(features_final.head(n=5))

# TODO: Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.copy(deep=True)
for (index, value) in income.iteritems():
#     print income[index]
    if value == "<=50K":
        income[index] = 0
    else:
        income[index] = 1
#     print income[index]

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features_final.columns)
print "{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
print encoded


# In[7]:

income.astype('int')
print income.dtypes


# In[8]:

print income.head(n=5)
display(features_final.head(n = 5))


# ### Shuffle and Split Data
# Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.
# 
# Run the code cell below to perform this split.

# In[9]:

# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_final, 
                                                    income, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, 
                                                    random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print "Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0])
print "Training set has {} labels.".format(y_train.shape[0])
print "Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0])
print "Testing set has {} labels.".format(y_test.shape[0])

# ## Evaluating Model Performance
# In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

# ### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
# *CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:
# 
# $$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$
# 
# In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).
# 
# Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 
# 
# 
# #### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall
# 
# ** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. Itâ€™s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).
# 
# ** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.
# It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of
# 
# `[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`
# 
# ** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.
# It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of
# 
# `[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`
# 
# For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).

# ### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
# * If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.
# 
# ** HINT: ** 
# 
# * When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. 
# * Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.

TP = np.sum(income) # Counting the ones as this is the naive case. Note that 'income' is the 'income_raw' data 
encoded to numerical values done in the data preprocessing step.

TN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case

# Print the results 
print "Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore)


# ###  Supervised Learning Models
# **The following are some of the supervised learning models that are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**
# - Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
# - Decision Trees
# - Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
# - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
# - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
# - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
# - Logistic Regression

# ### Question 2 - Model Application
# List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that you will test on the census data. For each model chosen
# 
# - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. 
# - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
# - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
# - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?
# 
# ** HINT: **
# 
# Structure your answer in the same format as above^, with 4 parts for each of the three models you pick. Please include references with your answer.

# **Answer: **  
# 1. Ensemble Methods(Random Forest) 
#     * House price prediction. The house prediction requires different types of data, numerical and categorical. This algorithm can handle this mix-data type problem.
#     * The Random Forest is a variation of the decision tree algorithm. The strength of this algorithm is that it contains the benefits of the original decision tree algorithm and reduce some overfitting issues. It can deal with numerical and categorical data in the same time, and it is a white box model which can be interpreted. When this decision tree type algorithm uses ensemble method, it can perform better. 
#     * This algorithm is easily overfitting and needs to be careful tuning parameters. Since it is an ensemble algorithm, the computation time will be an issue. When data contains many features, it will be easy to overfit and perform poorly.
#     * Even though the data has preprocessed by one-hot-encoding, it is still a numerical and categorical mixed data. This algorithm may be good at this type of data. One thing I am concerned is that there are too many features after the one-hot-encoding processes. I am not sure if it will be a significant issue.
# 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC) 
#     * If the data can be normalized in a specific case, we can have a try. This algorithm is good at normalized data.
#     * The strength of this algorithm is that it is efficiency and ease of implementation. When the data is sparse, this algorithm can deal with large scale training examples and features.
#     * The weakness of this algorithm is that we need to find out a regularization hyperparameters and the number of iterations. This issue will cause a lot of time to figure out a proper setting. Another issue is sensitiveness. When the data is not normalized, it is sensitive to feature scaling.
#     * The data has normalized. I think this algorithm will be a good candidate.
# 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
#     * This algorithm can be used in the most case. We can use this as a baseline to start our research.
#     * This algorithm is effective in high dimensional spaces and provides different kernel functions to meet different situations. When the proper kernel function is used, it performs best.
#     * The weakness is the overfitting issue which will happen when the feature number is much larger than the sample number. When the feature number is much larger than the sample number, it performs poorly.
#     * In this case, the sample number is larger than the feature number. If we can have a proper kernel function, this algorithm will be a good candidate.

# ### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
# To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).
#  - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.
#  - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.
#    - Record the total prediction time.
#  - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.
#  - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.
#    - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!

# ### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
# In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:
# - Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
# - Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
#   - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.
#   - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model â€” you will tune one specific model in a later section.
# - Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
#   - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.
# 
# **Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!

# ## Improving Results
# In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

# ### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model
# 
# * Based on the evaluation you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models you believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000. 
# 
# ** HINT: ** 
# Look at the graph at the bottom left from the cell above(the visualization created by `vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)`) and check the F score for the testing set when 100% of the training set is used. Which model has the highest score? Your answer should include discussion of the:
# * metrics - F score on the testing when 100% of the training data is used, 
# * prediction/training time
# * the algorithm's suitability for the data.

# **Answer: **
# * Ensemble Methods(Random Forest) has the highest F score, 0.6786.
# * The prediction time is 0.0564 sec, and the training time is 0.755 sec.
# * This algorithm is faster than I expected. It is obviously better than the previous naive prediction method. The F score is higher than 0.5. It shows that this algorithm may actually recognize this data set.

# ### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms
# 
# * In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical jargon, such as describing equations.
# 
# ** HINT: **
# 
# When explaining your model, if using external resources please include all citations.

# **Answer: **  
#  The fundamental idea of this model is a decision tree. Based on the feature condition, we made a decision path to provide a prediction. In this case, the model randomly selects a feature as a root point, then selects the next feature, and so on until the last feature. Based on this decision tree, we can have labels to know the result on the end of a path.  
#  However, the root affects the result because the root feature will cause a poor outcome if the root feature is not good at splitting data. That's why we use ensemble method here. Ensemble decision tree, Random Forest, is able to repeat the process many times, and have multiple decision trees which start from different root features. This method can reduce the root effect, but cause more computation time. 

# ### Implementation: Model Tuning
# Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
# - Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
# - Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
#  - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.
# - Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
#  - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
#  - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!
# - Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
# - Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
# - Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.
# 
# **Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!

# In[15]:

# TODO: Import 'GridSearchCV', 'make_scorer', and any other necessary libraries
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer
# TODO: Initialize the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()

# TODO: Create the parameters list you wish to tune, using a dictionary if needed.
# HINT: parameters = {'parameter_1': [value1, value2], 'parameter_2': [value1, value2]}
parameters = {'n_estimators':[10,100, 500], 'min_samples_split':[2,5]}

# TODO: Make an fbeta_score scoring object using make_scorer()
scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta=0.5)

# TODO: Perform grid search on the classifier using 'scorer' as the scoring method using GridSearchCV()
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(estimator=clf, param_grid=parameters, scoring=scorer)

# TODO: Fit the grid search object to the training data and find the optimal parameters using fit()
grid_fit = grid_obj.fit(X_train, list(y_train.values))

# Get the estimator
best_clf = grid_fit.best_estimator_

# Make predictions using the unoptimized and model
predictions = (clf.fit(X_train, list(y_train.values))).predict(X_test)
best_predictions = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Report the before-and-afterscores
print "Unoptimized model\n------"
print "Accuracy score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(list(y_test.values), predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(list(y_test.values), predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nOptimized Model\n------"
print "Final accuracy score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(list(y_test.values), best_predictions))
print "Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(list(y_test.values), best_predictions, beta = 0.5))


# ### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation
# 
# * What is your optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? 
# * Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? 
# * How do the results from your optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks you found earlier in **Question 1**?_  
# 
# **Note:** Fill in the table below with your results, and then provide discussion in the **Answer** box.

# #### Results:

# | :------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
# | Accuracy Score |                     |                   |                 |

# **Answer: **
# 
# |     Metric     | Benchmark Predictor | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
# | :------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
# | Accuracy Score |       0.2478        |      0.8377       |   0.8504        |

# 
# * The optimized model is better than the unoptimized model.

# ## Feature Importance
# 
# An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.
# 
# Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

# ### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
# When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?

# **Answer:**  
# Based on my intuition, I think the occupation, age, education_level, capital-gain, and capital-loss are the top five features in order. 
# * Occupation: Based on the job, it pretty decides the salary level so it the best feature to me. 
# * Age: Usually the older people gain more money.
# * Education_level: The higher education level usually has a higher income.
# * Capital-gain: If someone has a higher capital gain, it seems this person knows more about how to deal with finance. This type person usually has a higher salary.
# * Capital-loss: If someone has a higher capital loss, it seems this person has no idea what to deal with finance. This type person usually has a lower salary.

# ### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
# Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.
# 
# In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from the three used earlier.
#  - Train the supervised model on the entire training set.
#  - Extract the feature importances using `'.feature_importances_'`.

# In[16]:

# TODO: Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

# TODO: Train the supervised model on the training set using .fit(X_train, y_train)
model = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=10).fit(X_train, list(y_train.values))

# TODO: Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ 
importances = model.feature_importances_

# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)


# ### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance
# 
# Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  
# * How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**?
# * If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? 
# * If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?

# **Answer:**
# * The top five of important features are education-num, hours-per-week, age, occupation exec-managerial, and capital-gain. Only education-num is not on my list. Possibly, I misunderstood the meaning between the education_level and education-num.
# * The result is close to my thought. I expected the top features have higher weights, but the result is lower than my expected. The best feature is about 0.2 weight. On the other hand, the distribution of features is the same as what I expected. The features I selected are close and probably have the same weights. The result reflects my thought.
# * Only one feature I missed is education-num. It is probably that I misunderstand the feature meaning. By the way, the instruction is not good because the features definition is not clear.
# 

# ### Feature Selection
# How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower â€” at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 

# In[18]:

# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced,list(y_train.values) )

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print "Final Model trained on full data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(list(y_test.values), best_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(list(y_test.values), best_predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(list(y_test.values), reduced_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(list(y_test.values), reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5))


# ### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection
# 
# * How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?
# * If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?

# **Answer:**  
# 
# |     Metric     |      Full Data      |    Reduced Data  |
# | :------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------: | 
# | Accuracy Score |       0.8515        |      0.8126      |
# | F-score        |       0.7042        |      0.6123      |
# 
# * After reducing data, we have worse results including the accuracy score and F-score. Because of this, how to analyze the time and score is important. If we can reduce a lot of time and maintain acceptable scores, I will go reducing data. However, if the score drops a lot, I will not reduce data because the accurate prediction is the core of machine learning.
